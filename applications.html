    <h1>Applications of the technology</h1>

    <h2>Self-driving cars</h2>
    <p>Machine learning is increasingly being integrated into modern vehicles like in the development of self-driving cars. These vehicles appeal to many users due to the enhanced safety features, improved fuel efficiency, and overall convenience they offer. By reducing the need for human input, self-driving cars help alleviate the stress and fatigue commonly associated with long or congested drives. At the heart of this technology are machine learning algorithms that enable the car to interpret and respond to its environment in real time. This is made possible through many advanced sensors such as cameras, radar, and LiDAR all placed around the vehicle. These sensors constantly collect data about the car’s surroundings, including road conditions, traffic patterns, and pedestrian movement. However, before a self-driving system can reliably make decisions on its own, it must first be trained on vast amounts of driving data. This training typically involves many hours of human-operated driving, during which the system learns to recognize patterns, predict outcomes, and respond appropriately to various scenarios. Over time, the machine learning model becomes more accurate and capable, allowing the vehicle to drive itself with increasing amounts of reliability.</p>

    <p>Why do self-driving cars matter? Beyond individual convenience, self-driving cars offer more societal benefits. They can significantly improve road safety by reducing accidents caused by human error. Additionally, they boost productivity by freeing up commuting time and can help reduce traffic congestion through more efficient routing. Environmental gains are another key advantage. Many autonomous vehicles are electric and use energy more efficiently, contributing to lower emissions. However, these benefits depend on the vast amounts of data required to make self-driving systems work reliably. Gathering and updating this data is a major challenge. “Billions of miles [of data collected on the road] are just a drop in an ocean of real-world events and diversity. Yet, a missing data sample could lead to unsafe behavior and a potential crash” (Ohn-Bar, 2021). While sharing data across companies could speed up development, competition in the industry can prevent effective cooperation. Ultimately, self-driving cars matter because they have the potential to reshape transportation making it safer and more efficient if the technical and collaborative hurdles can be overcome.</p>

    <h2>Image/Facial Recognition</h2>
    <p>Machine learning is widely used in image recognition, a technology that allows computers to identify objects, people, or scenes in digital images. One of the most common uses today is facial recognition, especially for security purposes like unlocking devices or for law enforcement in identifying individuals. Facial recognition works by analyzing key features of a person’s face such as the distance between the eyes to create a unique digital “faceprint.” These faceprints are compared to those stored in a growing database, allowing the system to recognize specific individuals. As more images are processed, the system continues to learn and improve its accuracy. Beyond just identifying people, modern facial recognition technology can also determine characteristics like gender, age, and even emotional states.</p>
    
    <p>Why Does Facial Recognition Matter? Facial recognition technology plays a growing role in security and everyday convenience. Because every person’s face is unique, it offers a secure and fast alternative to regular passwords. Law enforcement agencies also use facial recognition to help identify suspects or find missing people, making it a useful tool for public safety. However, despite these benefits, the technology raises serious concerns about privacy and misuse. “Facial recognition technology has the potential to impact civil liberties, human rights, and privacy in meaningful ways, because it changes the scale and cost of collecting detailed data about a person’s every move” (Felton, 2024). Facial recognition can often be used without someone’s knowledge or consent, which leads to fears of constant surveillance. Another major concern is bias. Studies have shown that facial recognition systems can be less accurate for people from minority groups, leading to potential misidentification and unfair treatment. Because of these risks, many experts recommend creating strict guidelines for how the technology is used. Suggestions include limiting the storage of facial data, requiring user consent, and setting clear rules on when and where facial recognition can be applied.</p>
